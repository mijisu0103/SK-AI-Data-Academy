## About SK AI Data Academy ❓
SKADA, an online course organized by SK Group (South Korea), was launched in July 2024 for the first time. This programme targets university students who want to learn the foundational level of Python programming, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning.  
  
I removed all the company-related data due to their data protection regulation, hence this repository only contains non-confidential data.

## Motivation to take this course ⚙️
I chose to take the SKADA course to enhance my skill set and become more versatile in today's rapidly evolving technology landscape. With a background in culture, media, and creative industries, I recognised the importance of technical proficiency in leveraging new tools and technologies. I realised that the course not only equipped me with essential programming skills but also enhanced my problem-solving abilities, allowing me to tackle complex challenges through data-informed decisions. As I pursue my Master's in Computer Science, this foundational knowledge supports my academic endeavours and empowers me to innovate within my field. Ultimately, I believe that combining my creative background with these technical skills will set me apart and enable me to make a meaningful impact in the industry.
